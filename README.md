# Quantum-Autoencoder
6-qubit Quantum Autoencoder on IBM Qiskit for data compression and denoising. Compresses to a 2-qubit latent space, trained with SPSA for stable convergence. Tested on GHZ &amp; W-states, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction and noise reduction for near-term quantum systems.
